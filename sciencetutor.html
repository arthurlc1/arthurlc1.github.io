        <h2>Kerri Warne </h2>
        <h4>Biology & Geography</h4>
        <p>
          Hello! I am passionate, friendly and driven student currently in the final year of a Biology degree at the University of Bristol. I have extensive experience in tutoring students of all ages, including being a science mentor to GCSE student, completing the Teach First insight programme and acting as a committee member on the Schools Plus tutoring initiative at University. I am averaging a 1st in my studies so far, and at A-level achieved A* A* B in Biology, Geography and Chemistry respectively. 
          <br><br>
          Biography 
          <br><br>
          I studied at the High School for Girls, Gloucester, where I was always a driven student who took on as many extra-curricular activities as my time permitted. Here I found my love for biology and the world around me, and before starting at University I took a gap year where I travelled to Australia, India, China and Southeast Asia. To save up for this I worked full time for 6 months at Waitrose, where I have continued to work part time since returning. 
          <br><br>
          Personal approach…..
          <br><br>
          I am fully aware that each child learns in a different way, and to help them achieve their best, you need to be able to accommodate to a variety of different styles. Enthusiasm, clarity and a helping hand is all a student needs to help them get the most from their education. I aim not only to support them in the short term, but to also ignite some inspiration and desire to learn throughout the rest of their life. 
          <br><br>
          When I’m not tutoring…..
          <br><br>
          Beyond my studies, I’m a keen horse rider and gym goer, but also have a very active social life, and love nothing more than exploring new places with my friends and family. I love to read, and am hoping to start learning French in the coming year. 
        </p>

        <h2>Matt Walker</h2>
        <h4>Chemistry & Biology</h4>
        <p>
          Hello! I am an adaptable, outgoing and dependable second year medical student at the University of Bristol with previous tutoring experience of GCSE age students. My studies have allowed me to deepen my understanding of both biology and chemistry and thus I am able to offer tutoring in these subjects at GCSE level.
          <br><br>
          I attended a state school and state sixth form and left with A*s in GCSE biology and chemistry as well as an A and A* at A Level respectively. At sixth form I also received an award the ‘Overall Academic Achievement’ for the entire year group. Science has constituted a large part of my school life and I have therefore cultured a strong passion and enthusiasm for the subject – traits that I believe are necessary in order to tutor successfully and consequently allow students to fulfil their potential.
          <br><br>
          Having captained my local football team for 4 years I have developed patience and an ability to motivate individuals towards a common goal. In addition, my previous experience in mentoring younger students has taught me the importance of being able to cater for the individual needs of each pupil. Having very recently left the secondary school education system I have up to date knowledge of the specifications and key tips and tricks required in order to achieve maximum marks. Lessons will be tailored towards the different learning styles of the tutee and will be primarily based around the specification. I am a firm believer in the importance of reinforcing knowledge and thus topics will be continually revisited by exploring examination questions early on, this also helps the student become familiar with the types of questions that are asked. I also feel it is vital for the student to not only be able to answer questions, but to gain an understanding of the principles behind them. This ensures that when faced with some of the more challenging questions, students are able to tackle the problems from different angles, separating them from the majority of candidates.
          <br><br>
          Aside from my medical degree, in my free time I enjoy reading, running, cycling and playing competitive football for the medical school men’s team. I also plan to start on teaching first aid when I return to university having successfully completed the first aid examination.

        <h2>Tom Philips</h2>
        <h4>Physics</h4>
        <p>
          I have just finished my second year of an MSci degree in Physics & Philosophy at the University of Bristol, and so far it's been great. This summer, I am completing a research project here with the distinguished Professor of Biophysics, Mervyn Miles, and we have great hopes that our results will change the world.
          <br><br>
          I studied at a state grammar school in Plymouth, my hometown, where I achieved A* in both Maths and Physics at A Level, and an A in Further Maths.
          <br><br>
          I have been tutoring Maths and Physics since I was 16 and I try to inject my enthusiasm and passion for the subjects into my lessons. Maths is not a toolbox - it's a language (and a beautiful one)! I have given lessons for GCSE preparation, A Level preparation, and help for university admissions. Textbooks and online videos are good but most have imprecise/incorrect definitions, their questions are boring and they are unable to change their explanations if at first the concepts are unclear. That's why I can help; we can discuss exactly what you need and find something interesting or inspiring along the way to make it worth your while!

        <h2>Helen Harris</h2>
        <h4>Physics</h4>
        <p>
          I am a third year Chemical Physics student at the University of Bristol. I have been tutoring Physics and Maths at GCSE level for over a year but I am also available to tutor GCSE Chemistry.
          <br><br>
          Biography
          <br><br>
          At A-Level I achieved A*,A*,A,A (in Physics, Maths, Further Maths and Chemistry) whilst studying at Chesham Grammar School in Buckinghamshire. I am thoroughly enjoying my course at University and am employed as a PASS leader, which involves tutoring and mentoring second year Physics students. 
          <br><br>
          Personal Approach
          <br><br>
          At GCSE I believe it is important to understand not only the curriculum, but exactly what needs to be written to achieve full marks. Exam technique is as important as knowing the content! I am trained in explaining concepts in various ways, depending on the learning style of the student. 
          <br><br>
          When I'm not tutoring
          <br><br>
          I am a keen runner and cake baker!
