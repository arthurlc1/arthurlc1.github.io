        <h2>Sarah Espiritt </h2>
        <h4>Geography</h4>
        <p>
          I am a second year Law student at Bristol University. I can offer tuition in Geography, English Literature and Psychology.
          <br><br>
          Biography
          <br><br>
          I achieved A*A*A (Geography, Psychology and English Literature) in my A-levels. I attended a state school which sent very few people (3 in my year) to Russell Group universities so I am a very motivated person as well as being a strong proponent of the mantra that anything is possible, regardless of your background. This is the work ethic I will strive to encourage as a tutor. I am currently a mentor for year twelve and thirteen students wishing to study law at university and part of my role as mentor also has me assisting them in their revision given that I studied some of the A-levels they are currently doing.
          <br><br>
          Personal Approach
          <br><br>
          I will prepare my lessons in accordance to each student’s unique requirements and working techniques, whether that be learning content ahead of what is being taught in school or focusing on a topic which is of a particular difficulty. I appreciate that people work in different ways; I myself am a very visual learner so I make sure that my notes are relatable to pictures which I can remember when sitting exams. I will use the opportunity I have been given as a tutor to create a comfortable space for each student, in which they can ask questions which they might not have been confident enough to ask in the classroom. Exam technique is a huge part of doing any exam well which is why I will look to develop their exam technique and have each student comfortable and familiar with what is expected of when with more than enough time before sitting their exams.

          When I’m not tutoring…
          <br><br>
          When I am not tutoring, I am often planning day trips with friends as I love to travel and explore new places. I am a lover of the outdoors and believe that in order to be successful in your studies, a healthy work life balance is important.

        <h2>Kerri Warne </h2>
        <h4>Biology & Geography</h4>
        <p>
          Hello! I am passionate, friendly and driven student currently in the final year of a Biology degree at the University of Bristol. I have extensive experience in tutoring students of all ages, including being a science mentor to GCSE student, completing the Teach First insight programme and acting as a committee member on the Schools Plus tutoring initiative at University. I am averaging a 1st in my studies so far, and at A-level achieved A* A* B in Biology, Geography and Chemistry respectively. 
          <br><br>
          Biography 
          <br><br>
          I studied at the High School for Girls, Gloucester, where I was always a driven student who took on as many extra-curricular activities as my time permitted. Here I found my love for biology and the world around me, and before starting at University I took a gap year where I travelled to Australia, India, China and Southeast Asia. To save up for this I worked full time for 6 months at Waitrose, where I have continued to work part time since returning. 
          <br><br>
          Personal approach…..
          <br><br>
          I am fully aware that each child learns in a different way, and to help them achieve their best, you need to be able to accommodate to a variety of different styles. Enthusiasm, clarity and a helping hand is all a student needs to help them get the most from their education. I aim not only to support them in the short term, but to also ignite some inspiration and desire to learn throughout the rest of their life. 
          <br><br>
          When I’m not tutoring…..
          <br><br>
          Beyond my studies, I’m a keen horse rider and gym goer, but also have a very active social life, and love nothing more than exploring new places with my friends and family. I love to read, and am hoping to start learning French in the coming year.

        <h2>Hannah Hewitt</h2>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          A-Levels: History (A*), Geography (A), Maths (A)
          <br><br>
          When completing my GCSEs at my secondary school I was forced to be proactive in my revision and construct my own learning materials in order to build upon and strengthen what I was being taught in lessons. Fast forward to A-Levels at my new sixth form. These materials that I produced to revise were used by my teachers and distributed to students as core revision material. Having to challenge and stretch myself had a positive impact on not only me but my peers as well. It is this positive impact and active, forward thinking that will ensure that you will succeed as a student under by mentoring. 
          This is not my first time mentoring pupils. Throughout my time in full time education I took on many support roles from Peer Mentors to School Prefects. This taught me how to guide and encourage both students and peers through challenging times, especially in the run up to exams.
          <br><br>
          Personal Approach
          <br><br>
          I have such a passion for my subject. It is something that has never gone away and is something that I want to utilise to inspire the next generation of university students. Having a passion for what you are studying is essential and I guarantee that with my mentoring will draw out all the things you love about history - the things, from my experience, that pupils tend to focus more on - and magnify them 1000x to improve your approach to the subject as a whole in order to strengthen potential ‘problem’ areas. In doing this I will also endeavour to begin to prepare you for future life as a university student and stretch your knowledge and approach to prepare you for university expectations.
          <br><br>
          When I’m not tutoring…
          <br><br>
          I’m researching of course! What else would a history student be doing? I carry out a lot of research for non-profit organisations both in Bristol and London to be used in upcoming projects and assessments. Non-academically, I am a dancer and I love music so you will usually find me doing anything that involves one or the other, most of the time both!

        <h2>Eve Edwards</h2>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Eve and I am a second year History student at the University of Bristol. I have been tutoring over the past two years in a diverse range of subjects from Maths to English and History, at both KS3 and GCSE level. During my secondary education, my school instilled within me a passion for learning, through their communicative and hands-on approach. This has transgressed to my own tutoring methods, and my key goal is to make learning the most fun and accessible it can be. 
          <br><br>
          Biography
          <br><br>
          I remained at the same school in London from Reception to Year 13, and what I found most important about my experience there was the relationship all of our students developed with the teachers. Not only did the school follow a policy of mutual respect, but the outstanding results they achieve derive from the individual students being able to seek help and advice from their teachers and mentors. This led me to gain 10 A* and A grades at GCSE, an A* A* A in History, Music, and English Literature A-Level, with a B in Maths AS. Although I chose to study History at University, my love for all my previous subjects has not gone away, and I continue to pursue them in my extra curricular life. 
          <br><br>
          Personal Approach
          <br><br>
          In my previous tutoring experience, I found that the most successful and effective methods of teaching is through an engaging programme.  I would endeavour to tailor the sessions to the individual, so they can get the most out of their education. To find out the ways in which the student learns, be it through memory tests, debating topics, or a more visual approach to learning. I would hope to transfer my own range of revision techniques that led me to my success, along with other ways of learning to the tutee. Doing so, I hope that we would build a relationship of mutual respect and understanding through which we could tap into and unlock their potential for learning. I believe that what you draw from the individual is of equal importance to what you put in. 
          <br><br>
          When I'm not tutoring...
          <br><br>
          I'm in the music societies at my University, of which I will be creating and leading my own musical ensemble group in the coming year. I also have continued to follow my love of debate, by attending the wide variety of discussions and lectures available to us at UoB. I would classify myself as a people person, and delegate downtime to also socialising and enjoying everything Bristol has to offer with my friends.
