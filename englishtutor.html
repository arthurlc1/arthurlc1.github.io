          Hello! I am currently a second year undergraduate English Literature student at Bristol University. I am highly motivated and believe tutoring is a great way of sharing my passion for the subject. 
          <br><br>
          Biography
          <br><br>
          I achieved 3 A*s at A- Level in English, History and Philosophy, as well as completing an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) on my chosen topic of dystopian literature, and its importance as a reflection of society. 
          <br><br>
          Personal Approach
          <br><br>
          I have previous experience in privately tutoring GCSE students, and have found the best approach is a friendly, personable one. I strongly believe it is important to feel comfortable when trying to grasp challenging concepts, especially with a course as subjective as English. I have always established a good rapport with my students, and have consequently enabled them to reach their full potential. 
          <br><br>
          When I'm not tutoring 
          <br><br>
          I can be found working my part-time job as a Healthcare Advisor at Boots, or if not reading a good book! I also love to travel and explore new places.
          <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Leila al-mitwaly</h2>
        <h4>English</h4>
        <p>
          I have just completed my first year of English at the University of Bristol. My course has allowed me to study a wide range of literature, and significantly develop my analytic and essay writing skills. I am a sociable and energetic tutor who can teach GCSE level English Literature and English Language. 
          <br><br>
          Biography
          <br><br>
          I attended secondary school in Cardiff, where I achieved ten A*’s at GCSE and three A*’s at A-level. My admiration for my English teachers at GCSE level played a large part in my motivation to study the subject at university, and so I believe that a genuine passion for a subject is what defines a good teacher and instills real confidence in students. Growing up I have been a committed musician alongside my academic studies, being a leading member of my school’s orchestra from a young age and achieving grade 8 certificates in piano, cello and singing.
          <br><br>
          Personal approach
          <br><br>
          I have non-academic experience teaching children and teenagers, having trained as a tennis coach and teaching beginner music lessons while in school myself. Having completed my GCSEs just three years ago, I have a fresh and thorough knowledge of the syllabus and am excited to revisit the texts I grew to love. I believe that the most important skill required to succeed in English is essay writing, and therefore place emphasis on improving writing skills in my tuition. My love and enthusiasm for the subject will hopefully encourage students to enjoy reading and writing independently of their studies – which will of course make success in English exams easier to achieve. My cheerful and approachable personality coupled with my recent success in GCSE and A-level exams gives me the ability to relate to students and make them feel comfortable to voice their opinions and questions - as I was in their position myself not long ago!
          <br><br>
          When I’m not tutoring
          <br><br>
          When I’m not studying or reading recreationally, my free time is largely taken up by musical commitments – I am part of a band at university and practice consistently. Additionally, I enjoy socializing, travelling, and writing poetry and songs.

        <h2>Verity Ambler</h2>
        <h4>English</h4>
        <p>
          I am currently a second year English Literature student at the University of Bristol. I can offer tuition in English Language, English Literature and History at GCSE and A Level.
          <br><br>
          Biography
          <br><br>
          I attended Charterhouse School for sixth form where I held a scholarship for academic excellence. I achieved A Level/Pre-Us in English Literature, History and Philosophy all to A* level. I won the year group prize for English Literature for two consecutive years and was also chosen to be a peer mentor in English for the younger years. After school I took a gap year where I studied for a TESOL qualification and used it to travel to Vietnam to teach English.
          <br><br>
          Personal Approach
          <br><br>
          I think the most important thing is to tailor the lessons to individual student’s needs. I also find, particularly with essay subjects, confidence in one’s writing style is crucial to doing well. I believe each lesson should have an achievable yet challenging aim and that the student’s progress should be closely followed.  I try to focus on areas the students find interesting, as it should be fun!
          <br><br>
          When I’m not tutoring…
          <br><br>
          Other than studying for university and tutoring I really love to read and travel and when I can I also enjoy horse riding and snowboarding.

        <h2>Anna Lincoln </h2>
        <h4>English</h4>
         <p>
            My name is Anna and I am currently a second year English undergraduate at the University of Bristol. I can offer tuition in English Literature and Language, and also in essay writing techniques for other humanities subjects. I have several years of experience working with teenagers in a youth group I am involved with.
            <br><br>
            Biography
            <br><br>
            I studied English literature, History and French at A Level, achieving A*A*A, then went straight on to study English at Bristol. Throughout my school career I have been involved in various magazines and newspapers, taking editorial roles and also contributing my own articles. I have always loved the humanities, especially languages, and have recently begun to teach myself Spanish. In Sixth form I co-chaired the feminist society, leading meetings and organising the group. I have also been part of musical ensembles since I was a child, achieving grade 8 in flute and playing in incredible venues such as the Royal Albert Hall.
            <br><br>
            Personal Approach
            <br><br>
            I like to tailor my lessons to each pupil by getting to know their personalities and learning styles, and locating their strengths and weaknesses. I am familiar with the current curriculums and with the exam criteria, so I can guide pupils towards techniques that will help them get the best grades. I aim to build up confidence in my pupils, and to make learning English as engaging and exciting as possible.
            <br><br>
            When I’m not tutoring                                                     
            <br><br>
            In my spare time I enjoy reading, playing flute, attending the university’s ceramics and yoga societies, and spending time with my friends and family.

        <h2>Jess Hull</h2>
        <h4>English</h4>
        <p>
          Biography
          <br><br>
          I have much experience working with students of all ages in a teaching environment; whilst at school I led weekly reading sessions with younger students who were struggling to engage with particularly challenging texts. Over summer I enjoyed volunteering at a kids’ camp where I encouraged the children to tackle their weaknesses, demonstrating that they were capable of much more than they had previously thought. When I’m not tutoring I have a keen interest in writing and have worked directly under the editor of the Stockport Mail, as well as contributing to various university publications.
          <br><br>
          Personal Approach
          <br><br>
          I often find students become disillusioned when studying English or History at school, as the texts are not presented in an engaging way. I like to approach texts from a different angle with my students, finding an aspect that interests or affects them personally – something they can relate to. I always ask my students to identify their strengths and weaknesses, tailoring each session to focus on areas which require most attention. Rather than fact retention, English and History require understanding of an idea or event; for this reason I work to make sure my students understand their subject in depth, and so can feel comfortable and confident at exam time. Exam technique is key, particularly with essay subjects, and hard work is necessary – practice, practice, practice.
          <br><br>
          When I’m not tutoring…
          <br><br>
          In my spare time I like to work on my drawing and painting. I’m also a member of Amnesty International, a human rights organisation which works to prevent and raise awareness of abuse worldwide.
