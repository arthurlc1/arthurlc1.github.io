          <p>
            I am a second year Mathematics student at University of Bristol. I have previous experience in tutoring Mathematics both inside and outside of School.
            <br><br>
            At A2 level I achieved A*A*AA in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Geography respectively. I also have an AS level in Biology. At GCSE I achieved A's in English Language     and         Chemistry, A*'s in English Literature, Maths, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Geography, German, ICT, Business Studies and Dance. I was head Maths Prefect at the     sixth form I went to         which meant I had to attend weekly sessions with the younger years, giving me experience in tutoring Maths of all secondary and sixth form years.     Additionally, I have tutored younger        pupils outside of school too.
            <br><br>
            I feel like for Maths and Sciences there is usually a base idea that is sometimes hard to grasp, and then the rest is easier to follow. I find it best when you don't just    give them        the answer but try to help them to get it themselves. This way they've thought about how to get the answer which can make them memorise how they would do     it  again. Maths and Sciences        are very much practical subjects which is easiest learnt by lots and lots of practice!
            <br><br>
            I enjoy my sports outside of learning including trampolining, gymnastics, dance and cheerleading.

            <p>
              I am a second year Mathematics student at Bristol University. I offer tuition in Maths, Further Maths and Geography at both GCSE and A-level standard. Both of these subjects are subjects I enjoy greatly and received A*,A* in Maths and Further Maths and A in Geography at A-level. I am an enthusiastic, relaxed and patient person who throughout Sixth Form mentored and tutored younger students and peers. I work closely with the students in finding methods and developing an understanding in a way that works for them. It is very rewarding to see a young person's confidence grow as they understand more. I do not focus solely on weaknesses but also aim to grow interest in areas of strength. I would love to help with these subjects  in any way I can.<br>

            Intro
            <br><br>
            I am a friendly, approachable and confident student in my penultimate year studying mathematics at the University of Bristol, having last year achieved scores equivalent to a 1st. I am passionate about my subject and hope that my love for maths engages students, encouraging their ability as we work towards their individual targets. 
            <br><br>
            Biography
            <br><br>
            I achieved A-level grades of A*A*A*A (in maths, further maths, physics and chemistry respectively), and prior to this, 10 A*s and 4 As at GCSE level. In the past, I have helped coach a number of friends and family members through both GCSEs and A-levels, assisting them achieve beyond their targeted grades. Whilst taking part in a charity project in Africa, I gained some further experience of teaching maths and science. After my GCSEs, I also spent a week at Oxford University with other elite young mathematicians. 
            <br><br>
            Personal Approach
            <br><br>
            I believe it is essential to cement the basics, so that they become second nature. Then, I can help build upon each student's ability at their own rate. A key aim of mine is to help students enjoy learning about the foundations of science and maths. I ensure students are aware of the syllabus, to help attain a rounded knowledge. Plus this allows them to outline their own strengths and weaknesses, which can then be used to their advantage.  Exam technique is also crucial, and will be given necessary attention. For me, students strive when they understand why mathematical and scientific processes work; this is an essential part of my approach. 
            <br><br>
            When I'm Not Tutoring 
            <br><br>
            When not studying maths, I am a keen drummer and also like to involve myself in charity projects. I enjoy evenings at pub quizzes with friends and supporting our local football team at home with family.

          <p>
            I am a 3rd year Mathematics student at the University of Bristol and can offer tutoring in Mathematics and Further Mathematics up to A2 Level. 
            <br><br>
            I achieved A*AA (Maths, Further Maths, Biology) in my A-Levels. This last year I have been working as a personal one-on-one tutor through 'Action Tutoring' alongside my studies. 
            <br><br>
            I develop a programme that is tailored to what the student feels they need help with, as well as providing further clarity on topics shown to be difficult based on tests and other assessments from school. The very first session is dedicated to working out where the pupil is in their Maths, in addition to establishing what we seek to achieve from our time together. Following this, I produce a timeline of what will be covered in the available time and this provides the road map for what to do. A breadth of resources and questions is used as the best way to achieve the highest grades in Mathematics is to practice as many questions as possible which test techniques explicitly and the application of these techniques. Open and honest communication between the student and I is key, as well as consolidating knowledge from previous sessions and developing exam technique throughout our time together. 
            <br><br>
            I enjoying going to watch live music in my spare time as well as cooking and hosting dinner parties with friends and family. I am keen singer and enjoying singing in choirs and other music groups.<br>
