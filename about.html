            Arthur and I were both tutored throughout our teenage years often by university students. From our experience we learned that we both thrived most when our tutors engaged and understood us, often this occurred when we had more in common with our tutor. We always looked forward to our sessions with these people and as a result we took more in and generally had a lot of fun. We therefore take our time to understand the requirements of each student and personally match them with a tutor. We believe that university students who have a real passion for the subject they tutor make the best tutors because the best way to learn, is to have a genuine interest.
            <br><br>
            We know how busy people can get, we have therefore made our booking process as simple as possible. Just send us an email with a request and we will get back to you the same day. The payment method is very simple and is in the form of a monthly bill which will be sent to you. Our rates start from Â£25 per hour.
